this is file 2 of git course
adding more content to file 2

swithing branch open a completely different timeline 
meaning if one file exists in one branch in the other it won't exist

while switching if a branch won't exists it will create one.

switch -> newer method
checkout - old method

switch -c --> create and switch

commit before changing head
.gitkeep --> to keep that empty folder since git doesn't track empty
folder

git branch bug-fix
creates a new branch named bug-fix, but does NOT switch to it.
head always points towards the tip of the current branch.

points added to understand not fast forward merge.
